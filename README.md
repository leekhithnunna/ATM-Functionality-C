# ATM-Functionality-C
A C program that simulates the basic functioning of an ATM machine with multi-language support (English and Hindi).

# Functioning of ATM (English and Hindi) in C

This project is a simulation of an ATM machine built using the C programming language. It features a simple console-based interface, supporting **multi-language interactions (English and Hindi)**, basic banking operations like balance inquiry, withdrawal with denomination breakdown (using ASCII art), quick cash, and mini-statements.

The program is designed to demonstrate the foundational concepts of **C programming**, **control structures**, **functions**, **arrays**, and **terminal-based UI** using ANSI escape codes.

## üåê Run the Project on [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)

As this project uses the `ncurses` library (Linux-specific), it is **recommended to run on OnlineGDB** or a similar online compiler for demonstration purposes.

### Steps:
1. Open [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler).
2. Copy and paste the code into the editor.
3. Click **Run** to execute the program.
